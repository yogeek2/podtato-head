# Kapp

https://get-kapp.io/

Kapp is a simple deployment tool focused on the concept of "K8S application" = a set of resources with the same label.
Deploy and view groups of Kubernetes resources as "applications".
Apply changes safely and predictably, watching resources as they converge.

## Basic usages

### Deploy from a directory

- Deploy an application :

```
kapp deploy -a podtatohead-app -f ../manifest/manifest.yaml
```

- Inspect an app : `kapp inspect -a podtatohead-app --tree`
- Display apps : `kapp ls`
- Update an app :
  - either make a change in the manifest.yaml or edit the deployment manually (`kubectl edit deploy helloservice -n demospace`)
  - display diff : `kapp deploy -a podtatohead-app -f ../manifest/manifest.yaml --diff-changes`
- Delete app : `kapp delete -a podtatohead-app` !

### Deploy with Helm charts

```
kapp -y deploy -a podtatohead-chart -f <(helm template hs ../charts/hello-server)
```

and simply delete with `kapp delete -a podtatohead-chart` !

### Deploy with Kustomize

```
kapp -y deploy -a podtatohead-kusto-app -f <(kustomize build ../kustomize/overlays/dev)
```

and simply delete with `kapp delete -a podtatohead-kusto-app` !

## Useful usages

- See what would be deployed

Example : If you want to check what resources Istio is going to deploy in your cluster :

```
kapp deploy -a istio -f <(istioctl manifest generate --set profile=default)
```

- No need to write a script to wait until all your resources are _really_ created : kapp is waiting for all dependencies of your resources to be ready.
