# Progressive Delivery with Flagger and Istio

https://docs.flagger.app/tutorials/istio-progressive-delivery

## Installation

### Install Istio

```
./setup/install-istio.sh
```

### Install Flagger

```
./setup/install-flagger.sh
```

## Deploy app

- Create a test namespace with Istio sidecar injection enabled:

```
kubectl create ns test
kubectl label namespace test istio-injection=enabled
```

- Create a deployment and a horizontal pod autoscaler:

```
kubectl apply -k github.com/weaveworks/flagger//kustomize/podinfo
```

- Deploy the load testing service to generate traffic during the canary analysis:

```
kubectl apply -k github.com/weaveworks/flagger//kustomize/tester
```

- Create a canary custom resource:

```
kubectl apply -f ./podinfo-canary.yaml
```

When the canary analysis starts, Flagger will call the pre-rollout webhooks before routing traffic to the canary.
The canary analysis will run for five minutes while validating the HTTP metrics and rollout hooks every minute.

After a couple of seconds Flagger will create the canary objects:

```
kubectl get deploy,svc,hpa,canary,virtualservices,destinationrules
```

- Trigger a canary deployment by updating the container image:

```
kubectl -n test set image deployment/podinfo podinfod=stefanprodan/podinfo:3.1.1
```

Flagger detects that the deployment revision changed and starts a new rollout:

```
kubectl -n test describe canary/podinfo
```

_Note_ : if you apply new changes to the deployment during the canary analysis, Flagger will restart the analysis.

A canary deployment is triggered by changes in any of the following objects:
- Deployment PodSpec (container image, command, ports, env, resources, etc)
- ConfigMaps mounted as volumes or mapped to environment variables
- Secrets mounted as volumes or mapped to environment variables

You can monitor all canaries with:

```
watch kubectl get canaries --all-namespaces
```

You can also follow the canary evolution interactively in Kiali:

```
kubectl port-forward svc/kiali 20001
```
